//============================= TypeScript Notes ==================================

Why to use the typeScript ? 
                        1) because typescript provide the functionality of the type-safety hence we have to use it within the javascript code make the type safety / means giving the data-type to the variables 
                        2) so because of the above feature we can build the our application with the type-safety 
                        3) because it analyze the code as we type thats it in short 
                        4) in typescript the code length will become more means the no of ines will get increased but it is going to be less prone error free code
                        5) typescript is the development tool , because your project still runs on the javascript 
                        6) typescript is the layer on top of the javascript
                        7) it helps to write the less error free code which is more scalable that is easily understandable and maintainable 
                        8) there are few new keywords are there like union , interface , any and more we will se it one by one  

Two major Extensions used : 
                    1) .tsx = typescript code with the jsx 
                    2) .ts = typescript code 


What is typescript Is and What typescript is NOT  : 
What is typescript Is : 
                    i) it does the static type-checking for you (this is the one main job typeScript does) like example : java , goLang 
                    ii) for example : (how it helps to track the errors at the development stage only)

                              suppose I have the one object and in that object one property is  mensioned with string data-type but I am trying to give the new value as the number format using 
                              the javascript then it should throw the error so at the development stage only I can handle the errors in such cases the typescript play very inportant role  

Why to transform the javascript code into the typescript code ?
when to use the typescript in your project ? 
                        1) if your project is small having the 4 to 5 files in it then it does not make any sense to use the javascript
                        2) you have to use the typescript the big projects which are having more files / complex logic / to give safety check for the data type 


Note : 
    1) All the code that we write in the typescript is finally get compiled into the javascript 
    2) it allows the functionality to write the javascript with little bit accurate behaviour so the errors will become less then use the typescript in your peoject 
    3) for the typescript files you have to use the .ts or .tsx extension (we prefer .tsx)



Diagram How it works : 

/*
  TypeScript Compilation Process:

  +---------------------+       +--------------------+       +-------------------+
  |  TypeScript Code    | --->  |  TypeScript        | --->  |  JavaScript Code  |
  |  (source.ts file)   |       |  Compiler (TSC)    |       |  (output.js file) |
  +---------------------+       +--------------------+       +-------------------+
           |                           |                          ^
           |                           |                          |
           v                           v                          |
   Syntax Checking            Type Checking            Transpilation (conversion)
                              (ensuring types match)
